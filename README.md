| **Finding**                                | **Summary**                                                                                                                    | **Impact**                                                                                                                     | **Recommendations**                                                                                                      |

| **High Risk Findings**                     |                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                          |
| H-01. Password Handling in Deployment Script | Plain passwords are passed directly in the DeployPasswordStore.s.sol script, which is insecure.                               | Exposes sensitive information and poses a security risk.                                                                      | A more secure approach is to read passwords from an environment file (e.g., .env). Replace direct password usage. |
| H-02. Storage of Plain-Text Passwords      | The PasswordStore contract's `setPassword` function stores plain-text passwords, a severe security risk.                        | Significant security risk due to potential unauthorized access and data breaches.                                             | Implement secure hashing and salting to protect user data.  |
| H-03. Access Control Lacking in setPassword Function | The `setPassword` function lacks proper access control modifiers or owner checks, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access. | Significant risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Implement access control or `onlyOwner` modifiers.     |
| **Low Risk Findings**                      |                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                          |
| L-01. Revert Usage in getPassword Function   | The `getPassword` function in the PasswordStore contract is not gas efficient due to the use of `revert`.                     | Inefficient gas usage, affecting code efficiency and readability.                                                            | Replace `revert` with a gas-efficient `onlyOwner` modifier.  |

| **Finding**                                | **Summary**                                                                                                                    | **Impact**                                                                                                                      | **Recommendations**                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Risk Findings**                     |                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                              |
| H-01. use transfer instead of sendValue    | Using sendValue for Ether transfers can expose the contract to reentrancy attacks.                                          | Potential reentrancy attacks, fund losses, and security risks.                                                                  | Use the transfer method for secure Ether transfers.                                                                          |
| H-02. current randomness is predictable    | The contract relies on on-chain data for randomness, which can be manipulated.                                                 | Predictable randomness can lead to unfairness and manipulation.                                                                | Implement a more secure source of randomness like Chainlink VRF.                                                           |
| H-03. withdrawFees has no access control    | The withdrawFees function lacks access control, allowing unauthorized users to withdraw fees.                               | Unauthorized withdrawal of fees, fund loss, and financial disruption.                                                         | Add an access control modifier, like onlyOwner, to the function.                                                            |
| **Medium Risk Findings**                  |                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                              |
| M-01. Gas-Intensive Duplicate Check         | The enterRaffle function's duplicate check can lead to denial-of-service attacks.                                             | Inefficient gas usage, unequal gas costs, and potential DoS attacks.                                                          | Consider using a different data structure to track participants.                                                             |
| **Low Risk Findings**                      |                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                              |
| L-01. Zero Return                          | Change the return value of the getActivePlayerIndex function for clarity and to avoid confusion.                             | Potential confusion due to a valid array index (0) misleading users.                                                          | Change the return value to a different constant, like -1, when the player is not found.                                    |
| L-02. use ERC721A instead of ERC721        | Consider using the ERC721A standard for gas efficiency and security optimization.                                            | High gas costs, security vulnerabilities with ERC721.                                                                         | Use ERC721A for better gas efficiency and security.                                                                        |
