## Contests Tips     

- Always focus on one Contest, finish it and then move to another one.
- Must read the platform docs before doing an audit contest.
    - e.g must read their reward distribution system
    - how they give severity to findings
    - how their penalties works [ this is important ]
    
- Always record low/informational findings as a side note when digging into code
    - report medium/high with PoC
    - if code PoC is somehow impossible make a convincing PoC in text form ;)
- Halmos testing
- Solodit is your fren
    - find all protocols reports which you are auditing
    - you will find most of the common attack vectors
