# Smart Contract Security Audit Process
by Iftikhar Uddin

## Audit Process Overview

### Pre-Audit Phase (One hour - 1 day)
During this initial phase, I evaluate the protocol's structure and codebase to:
- Assess the degree of decentralization
- Analyze code complexity and unique features
- Review access control logic
- Identify common vulnerabilities
- Provide preliminary security insights

Based on this assessment, I provide a detailed quote and timeline.

### Main Audit Phase
This phase begins after reaching an agreement on scope and terms, before I start this process you will pay 30% upfront to book the timeslot for your protocol audit.
- Comprehensive security review of the codebase
- Direct communication with protocol developers for clarifications
- Systematic documentation of findings with severity classifications
- Regular updates and issue reporting through GitHub
- Collaborative discussion of findings with the development team

### Post-Audit Phase
After issues are addressed:
- Review of all implemented fixes
- Verification of mitigations
- Final security assessment
- Mainnet deployment recommendations

## Pricing Structure

The audit price is calculated based on:
1. Number of Solidity lines of code (SLOC)
2. Code complexity factors:
   - Protocol integrations
   - Mathematical models
   - Custom implementations
   - Use of assembly/YUL
   - Novel mechanisms

Price per line of code ranges between [5, 10] USDC/USDT, based on complexity metrics from solidity-metrics.

## Duration Guidelines

| SLOC Range | Typical Duration |
|------------|-----------------|
| â‰¤ 500      | 3 days         |
| 501-1000   | 5 days         |
| 1001-1500  | 7 days        |
| 1501-2000  | 10 days        |

*Note: Duration may vary based on protocol complexity and specific requirements*

## Severity Classification

| Likelihood | High Impact | Medium Impact | Low Impact |
|------------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| High       | Critical    | High          | Medium     |
| Medium     | High        | Medium        | Low        |
| Low        | Medium      | Low           | Low        |

Impact factors:
- Technical implications
- Economic damage potential
- Protocol stability risks
- User fund security

Likelihood factors:
- Exploitation complexity
- Attack vector accessibility
- Required preconditions

## Types of Protocols I Don't Accept

- Fraudulent or deceptive protocols

## Disclaimer
While I strive for comprehensive security analysis, no audit can guarantee 100% security. My process aims to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, but ultimate responsibility for contract security remains with the development team.
